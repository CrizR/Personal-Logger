# PersonalLogger

For fun, I created a personal command line tool that allows me to log data to a local mongodb database about my current cognitive, physical, and emotional state, my diet, and regular messages. When logging this information, I get the current weather data at the time that the log took place (using my comp's IP to determine what city I'm in). I also use a basic sentiment analysis plugin to log whether or not the messages I input are positive. Using all of this data, I can tell what specific indicators impact my health, by doing some analytics on the data, and make adjustments accordingly.

## How I use it


To post information relevant to my current state I can do the following:

    python3 main.py -c 10 -cd "I feel smart" -p 5 -pd "I'm tired" -e 7 -ed "I'm happy"

    Input: {'2018-02-25 09': '{"data": {"cognitive": {"rating": "10", "description": "I feel smart", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emotional": {"rating": "7", "description": "I\'m happy", "sentiment": "positive"}, "physical": {"rating": "5", "description": "I\'m tired", "sentiment": "negative"}}, "weather": {"weather_type": ["Rain", "Mist"], "temperature": 276.33, "pressure": 1023, "humidity": 93, "visibility": 9656, "wind_speed": 5.7}}'}

To then graph this information:

    python3 main.py -graph all

To log a basic message:

    python3 main.py -log "weather test"
    
    Input: {'2018-02-25 09': '{"log": "weather test", "sentiment": "neutral", "weather": {"weather_type": ["Rain", "Mist"], "temperature": 276.07, "pressure": 1025, "humidity": 80, "visibility": 14484, "wind_speed": 7.61}}'}

To log your food:

    python3 main.py -dinner pasta,pizza,ice_cream
    
    python3 main.py -lunch pasta,pizza,ice_cream
     
    python3 main.py -breakfast pasta,pizza,ice_cream

To print information:

    python3 main.py -lprint console # For Logs
    
    python3 main.py -dprint console # For Data
    
    python3 main.py -fprint console # For Food
    
Optionally this can be dumped to a file as well:

    python3 main.py -lprint file # For Logs
    
    python3 main.py -dprint file # For Data
    
    python3 main.py -fprint file # For Food
    
To reset all data (Will also dump to file):

    python3 main.py -reset logs # For Logs
    
    python3 main.py -reset data  # For Data
    
    python3 main.py -reset food  # For food

To just delete everything:

    python3 main.py -fdel


To import data:

    python3 main.py -ilogs file # For Logs
    
    python3 main.py -idata file  # For Data
    
    python3 main.py -ifood file  # For Food Logs
    
    
To see stats (all, year, month, week):

    python3 main.py -stats all
  
    Number of Logs:				|23
    Number of Progress Logs:		|6
    Percent Positive 			|78.05%
    Percent Neutral 			|14.63%
    Percent Negative 			|7.32%
    Most Common Weather:			|Clouds
    Most Positive Weather:			|Snow
    Most Negative Weather:			|Rain
    Most Neutral Weather:			|Rain
    Average Cognitive Rating:		|64.17
    Average Physical Rating:		|65.83
    Average Emotional Rating:		|65.83

  



On my computer I've created an alias that simplifies many of these commands, you can too by altering your ~/.bash_profile
